# 3 Side Projects

## 1.  Traffic Analysis
-  I create a project to provide real time analysis from CCTV footage.
-  Create a bounding box using Haar Cascade Classifier to detect cars in video.
-  Create speed estimate function to calculate speed using Euclidean distance formula.

## 2. Image Processing
-  I create 3 python function to do image processing. the objective is to improve image quality.
-  Reduce Underexposed Image function, Reduce Exposure Image function, Reduce Grainy Image function.
-  technique used is mostly playing with contrast and brigness. some function has additional processing such as Gaussian Blur, 
LAB color space, CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization), and Non-local Mean Denoising.

## 3. Generative AI
-  I build a RAG chatbot with open-source LLM model.
-  Use streamlit as UI Framework.
-  Use llama_index and huggingface api to laod open-source LLM model.
-  Use Huggingface embedding model to create vector store for efficient retrieval.

If you have made it this far, I would first like to congratulate you! We have a very rigorous selection process here in the Artificial Intelligence/ Machine Learning team.\nThe following take home challenge is meant to gauge your technical and analytical ability. Don\u2019t worry if you are unable to complete them all (we do not expect you to, this is a \ndiversified challenge designed to find out which roles fit you best). That being said, we do encourage you to at least attempt them all. Each section can be answered relatively \nindependently from one another, and so, if you find yourself stuck with one section, try to answer all the other sections to the best of your ability.\nPlease be prepared to provide a clear, step-by-step explanation to your answers. We are also trying to see how well you present your ideas and logic.\nDo feel free to use all resources available to you (this is an open book challenge!). If you think you can provide a much better set of answers given extra time, please contact \nus, and do reach out to us if you have any questions or clarifications.\nIf you feel like you have better suggestions to expand this challenge, we are open to feedback, and to changing it to better suit you. Good luck, and most importantly, have fun \ncoding!\n \nChallenge 1: Traffic Analysis\nUse case: As a township operator, traffic congestion is a significant challenge we face. We are exploring the use of AI to address this issue and assist our management in \nmaking informed decisions to alleviate traffic congestion.\nProduce an algorithm that is able to take in video stream and perform vehicle tracking/counting. The video stream will preferably be a video footage taken from an angle of a \nCCTV (top-down view). Before you start with the challenge, do make sure that you are clear with the difference between vehicle tracking/counting and vehicle detection. For \nexample, of top-down view see below:\n \nBy the end of the challenge, your should:\nBe able to provide an analysis of traffic trend collected from the CCTV footage that you have selected.\nHave bounding boxes around a detected vehicle and be able to explain the difference between vehicle detection and vehicle tracking.\nHave a near real time inference speed.\nSome additional feature to consider:\nWhat are some value added data points that can be added to provide a more comprehensive traffic analysis?\nHow can the traffic analysis data be used to alleviate traffic congestion?\nPlease list down your assumptions & caveats of the system that you have developed.\n \nChallenge 2: Image Processing\nGet a sample image of your choice which is overexposed, underexposed, grainy or blurry. Work towards improving the quality of image so that the overall image composition \nis drastically improved.\nBy the end of the challenge, your image processing algorithm should:\nBe able to improve the image quality.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2904, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d02420af-c528-4253-a0be-8be982d48398": {"__data__": {"id_": "d02420af-c528-4253-a0be-8be982d48398", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "saved_pdf.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\PC\\OneDrive - Universiti Malaya\\Documents\\Github Project\\Sunway\\data\\saved_pdf.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 306239, "creation_date": "2024-09-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-09-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "407850a1-cac4-431b-806f-bdfdd3e2a6c7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "saved_pdf.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\PC\\OneDrive - Universiti Malaya\\Documents\\Github Project\\Sunway\\data\\saved_pdf.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 306239, "creation_date": "2024-09-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-09-02"}, "hash": "89fc0ff1a2fa239e33dba1db26b313f16400afdff338ef8712980905ee2fcc00", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Challenge 3: Generative AI \nBuild a RAG chatbot with any open source or free LLM model and knowledge base of your own.
